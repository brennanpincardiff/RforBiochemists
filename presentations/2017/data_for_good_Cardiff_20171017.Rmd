## Becoming a better data analyst
1. Crisis in reproducibility
2. An opportunity and insipration
3. Willingness to learn and share
4. Support of an open source community 

## Crisis and opportunity
- Reproducibility in cancer research is not as good as we would like
- Looked at our internal data analysis methods
- Dependent on expensive click and go software packages

[https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970]

## An opportunity and inspiration
- Proteomics data
- Submitted for publication
- Analysis not robust enough
- Set out to learn more....
- data viz I couldn't do in Excel

![](/Users/paulbrennan/Desktop/vizThis.png )

## Inspiration 
- [A few lines of code = new data viz!](https://flowingdata.com/2010/01/21/how-to-make-a-heatmap-a-quick-and-easy-solution/)
```{r, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE, warning= FALSE}
library(RCurl)
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(bitops)

nba <- read.csv("http://datasets.flowingdata.com/ppg2008.csv")
nba <- nba[order(nba$PTS),]
row.names(nba) <- nba$Name
nba <- nba[,2:20]
nba_matrix <- data.matrix(nba)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning= FALSE, fig.height=4}
nba_heatmap <- heatmap(nba_matrix, 
                       Rowv=NA, Colv=NA, 
                       col = cm.colors(256), scale="column")
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```


## Opportunity 
- Our data for a publication
- Alsagaby SA, et al J Proteome Res. 2014 13:5051-62 [doi: 10.1021/pr5002803](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/pr5002803)


## Opportunity
My first cluster dendrogram
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning= FALSE}
# import the data
data2 <- read.csv("http://science2therapy.com/data/iTRAQPatientforCluster.csv", header=TRUE)
attach(data2)  # attaching a data.frame means we can use the headings directly. 
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning= FALSE, fig.height=3.5}
# make the cluster dendrogram object using the hclust() and dist() functions
hc <- hclust(dist(rbind(P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, P11, P12)))  

# plot the cluster dendrogram 
plot(hc, xlab = "Patient Samples")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning= FALSE}
detach(data2) # good practice to detach data after we're finished.
```

## Willingness to learn and share
- My professional society - [the Biochemical Society](https://www.biochemistry.org/). 
- Suggested a training day in R
- Then, I was organising it and delivering it
- Created a blog: R for Biochemists
- Delivered a training day - June 2015 
- Further training in Cardiff, Germany and [Namibia](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/phoenix-project)

## Open Source Learning & Teaching
 - [R for Biochemists Blog](http://rforbiochemists.blogspot.co.uk)
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning= FALSE, fig.height=4}

# this is the link to the data
link <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brennanpincardiff/RforBiochemists/master/data/pageViews.xlsx"

# the download.file() function downloads and saves the file with the name given
download.file(url=link,destfile="file.xlsx", mode="wb")

# then we can open the file and extract the data using the read_excel() function. 
data<- read_excel("file.xlsx")
ggplot(data = data, 
       aes(x = data$Month, y = data$Pageviews)) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_line() +
  ylab("Monthly Page Views") +
  xlab("") +
  theme_bw()
     
```

## Open Source Learning & Teaching
 - [R User Group](http://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/)
 - Making packages - talk on 2nd of November
 - twitter: @brennanpcardiff #rstats
 
## Package development
 - A package is a collection of R functions
 - Created and shared with the community
 - Packages are being developed regularly
 - Hosted on github, CRAN, Bioconductor
 
## drawProteins Package
 - Bringing together webscraping and data visualisation
 - Our bodies are made up of cells
 - These cells depend on molecules called proteins
 - Built a package to generate visualistions of these proteins

## drawProteins Package - learning continues
 - Testing functions
 - Package coverage
 - Documentation
 
## drawProteins Package - demo
Keratin - an important skin and hair protein
```{r keratin_drawProtein_demo, echo = FALSE, warning= FALSE, fig.height=4}
library(magrittr)
library(drawProteins)
library(httr)
library(ggplot2)

# accession numbers of hair keratin
"Q14533 P19012 P02538" %>%
  drawProteins::get_features() ->
  protein_json

# included data in package of one protein
protein_json %>%
  drawProteins::feature_to_dataframe() ->
  prot_data

prot_data %>%
  geom_chains() %>%
  geom_domains() %>%
  geom_region %>%
  geom_motif %>%
  geom_phospho(size = 8) -> p

p <- p + theme_bw(base_size = 20) +  # white background and change text size
  theme(panel.grid.minor=element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major=element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank()) +
  theme(panel.border = element_blank())

p <- p + labs(x = "Amino acid number",         # label x-axis
              y = "",  # label y-axis
              title = "Three keratin proteins",
              subtitle = "circles = phosphorylation sites\nsource:Uniprot")

# move legend to top
p <- p + theme(legend.position="top") + labs(fill="")
p
```
