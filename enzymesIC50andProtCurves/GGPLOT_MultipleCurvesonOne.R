# Following on from my code to multiplot 6 enzymology data-sets using base R in a for loop,
# here's how to create a single plot with all fitted curves on it too
# I have used ggplot and faceting.

# Some manipulation of the data is required, essentially to melt it from 'wide' to 'long' (reshape2)

# I personally don't like the standard ggplot look, so
# I also load package ggthemes and think Stephen Few's theme is the nicest (hence, theme_few())

# You may need to do this once: install.packages("ggplot2", "reshape2", "ggthemes")

library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)

# lets read the data in:
