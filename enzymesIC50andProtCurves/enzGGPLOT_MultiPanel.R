# the way ggplot draws colours depends on the required number of colours. The way it does it is just with equally spaced hues around the color wheel, starting from 15:
gg_color_hue <- function(n){
  hues = seq(15, 375, length = n + 1)
  hcl(h = hues, l = 65, c = 100)[1:n]
  }
  
# we have 6 experiments (so we want to create our own 6 colour "mini-palette")
cols <- gg_color_hue(6)  
# this gets the default ggplot colours when we want to plot 6 different variables.


# 1st, create an object with the ggplot 
# It has all the data simply as points, shaped and colour-coded by expt. of origin (as above). 
# We store it in an object called 'x':
x <- ggplot(data = melted_data, aes(x = Sub, y = v)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = Exp, shape = Exp)) +
  theme_few() +
  ylab("velocity (nmol/s)") + xlab("substrate (mM)") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size = 15),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 15),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 15),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 15),
        plot.title = element_blank(),            # we don't want individual plot titles as the facet "strip" will give us this
        legend.position = "none",                # we don't want a legend either
        panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, color = "darkgrey", size = 1.25, linetype = "solid"),
        axis.ticks = element_line(colour = 'darkgrey', size = 1.25, linetype = 'solid'))     # here, I just alter to colour and thickness of the plot outline and tick marks. You generally have to do this when faceting, as well as alter the text sizes (= element_text() in theme also)

# Next, let's modify 'x' by faceting based on the Experiment Name, 
# We also specify that we want a panel 3 plots wide x 2 plots high.
# You can change this, obviously. Can also 'facet_grid' too:
x <- x + facet_wrap( ~ Exp, ncol = 3)

# Finally, let's apply the Michaelis Menten fitting to our faceted data, adding the best fit line in each case:
x <- x + geom_smooth(method = "nls", formula = y ~ Vmax * x / (Km + x), start = list(Vmax = 50, Km = 2),
                     se = F, colour = 'black', size = 0.5)
					 
# Finally, just call 'x' to show the plots:
x

# if you want to save it as a .pdf, just add + ggsave("GGPLOT_FACET_EnzKin.pdf"), when you call 'x'
x + ggsave("GGPLOT_FACET_EnzKin.pdf")
